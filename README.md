The Smart Health Tracker System is an application designed for health-conscious users who want to monitor and manage their fitness and health data. The system integrates wearable devices (like smartwatches) to track heart rate, steps, sleep patterns, and calorie intake metrics. The system allows users to set fitness goals, receive personalized health insights, and share data with healthcare professionals. It also integrates with third-party nutrition and fitness data APIs to provide comprehensive reports.
